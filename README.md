# Comprehensive Study on Estimating S-Wave Intensity in New Zealand Earthquakes

The study focuses on estimating S-wave intensity (specifically, Peak Ground Velocity - PGV) using Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMM) applied to New Zealand earthquake data.

## 🧠 Research Summary

Earthquake Early Warning Systems (EEWS) are critical in seismically active regions like New Zealand. This study aims to:
- Identify the best predictors for estimating S-wave intensity.
- Assess the influence of P-wave parameters, station characteristics, and event-specific variables.
- Develop a robust, generalizable intensity estimation model using Linear Mixed-Effects Modeling (LMM).

Data from 54,000+ waveforms across 12,000+ earthquakes (2013–2022) was obtained via GeoNet. After filtering, ~29,000 waveforms recorded by 293 stations were used in the analysis.

## 📜 Abstract (Symposium 2024)

> The study presented at the **Annual Research Symposium 2024** (University of Colombo) proposes a generalized model to estimate S-wave intensity based on P-wave parameters. A Linear Mixed-Effects Model was found to outperform traditional regression models, especially in handling grouped data and station-level variability.
